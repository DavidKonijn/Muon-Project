# Muon-Project

This repository will be used for the personal code from David Konijn for the WOTmu Project

The goal of this project was to infer the lifetime of a muon by creating a working muon detector from scratch. As part of this project, I build the detector, acquired the data, and performed a high-level analysis of this data. I collaborated with ten other students on this project and each was focused on their own branch of research. With the working detector, we were able to produce a muon density function similar to that of Fermi theory, we were furthermore able to somewhat closely deduce the muon lifetime.

Visible in `decode_waveform_example.ipynb` is how we decoded the waveform gotten from the 32-channel analyser, and deduced the muon density function.
